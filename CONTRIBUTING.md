# Issues on the issue tracker

Please report issues rather than using old software versions. Unless problems are identified they'll never get corrected in new versions.

Please set an informative title when creating a new issue and specify the software's component (tracker, filter, protocol, or the main executable) you're having issues with. If you're unable to, please **create an issue anyway** as it's important that problems are identified.

Don't worry about your own English, it's not a problem since we'll be able to communicate anyway. If you're very concerned, please note that in the issue, and you'll receive responses in very plain English.
